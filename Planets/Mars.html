            <p>
                Mars , or the red planet, is the fourth planet in terms of distance from the sun in the solar system and it is the outer neighbor of the Earth .  Mars is classified as a rocky planet, from the group of terrestrial planets (similar to Earth).  As for its name in Arabic, it is derived from the word “ Amrakh ,” meaning the one with red spots, and it is said that the bull “Amrakh,” meaning it has red spots. As for Mars (in Latin : Mars ), it is the name of the god that the Romans adopted for war. As for the title of the red planet, it is due to its color. The planet is reddish or red due to the high percentage of iron(III) oxide dust on its surface and in its atmosphere.  The diameter of Mars is about 6,792 km (4,220 miles), which is equal to half the diameter of Earth and the second smallest planet in the solar system after Mercury . Its area is estimated at a quarter of the land area. Mars revolves around the Sun in an orbit approximately 228 million km away from it, i.e. 1.5 times the distance between the Earth's orbit and the Sun. The Northern Hemisphere's smooth Arctic Basin covers approximately 40% of the planet and could have a significant impact on the planet.  Mars has two moons, the first is called Deimos , meaning terror in Greek , and the second is Phobos , meaning fear . They are small and irregular in shape, and they could be asteroids that he captured,  similar to 5261 Eureka ,  which is Martian Trojan .

            <p>
                The area of ​​Mars is slightly more than a quarter of the Earth's area (28.4% of the Earth's area), which is slightly less than the area of ​​the Earth's land.  Mars' density also differs from that of Earth, as its size represents about 15% of the Earth's size, while its mass is equivalent to a tenth of the mass. Earth (11% of the Earth’s mass), and the surface gravity compared to Earth is about 38%, and the atmospheric pressure on the surface of Mars is 0.75% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth, so we see that the automated probes that the American Space Agency sent to Mars are encased in an air sphere. To absorb the shock when it hits the surface of Mars.

                <br>
                The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by iron(III) oxide or rust  , and other common Martian surface colors include gold, brown, tan, and green, depending on the minerals present. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The air of Mars consists of 95% carbon dioxide , 3% nitrogen , 1.6% argon ,  and a small portion of oxygen and water .  In the year 2000 AD, researchers reached results that suggested the existence of life on the planet Mars after examining pieces of a meteorite found on the Antarctic continent, and its origin from the planet Mars was determined as a result of comparing its mineral composition and the composition of the rocks that were examined from the Viking 1 and 2 vehicles, where The researchers inferred the presence of microfossils in the meteorite. However, the aforementioned hypothesis remains a matter of controversy without reaching a firm conclusion that there was life in the past on the planet Mars. 
                Mars is considered a rocky planet, and most of its surface is red except for some spots of a darker color due to its soil and rocks. The atmosphere of Mars is low-density and consists mainly of carbon dioxide and small amounts of water vapor. The atmosphere of Mars is colder than that of Earth. A year on Mars is 687 Earth days.

            <p>
                Mars experienced exactly what happened to Earth in terms of differentiation or differentiation . What is meant by differentiation here is the process that results in a difference in the density and components of each layer of the planet, such that the core or core of the planet is of high density and what is above it is less dense than it.  The current model of Mars has the following: The core extends over a radius of 1,794 ± 65 kilometers (1,115 ± 40 mi), and is mainly composed of 16-17% iron, nickel, and sulfur.  This iron sulphate core is partially liquid, and its concentration is twice that of the rest of the lighter materials in the core. This core is surrounded by a mantle of silicate, which forms many of the planet's tectonic and volcanic features but now appears dormant.  Besides silicon and oxygen, the most common elements in the crust of Mars are iron, aluminium, magnesium, calcium, and potassium.
                <br>
                <br>
                The average thickness of Mars' crust is 50 km (31 mi) and its maximum height is 125 km (78 mi),  while Earth's crust is 40 km (25 mi) thick. This thickness relative to the size of Earth is equivalent to one-third of the thickness of Mars' crust relative to the size of Earth. to its size.

                In 2016, the InSight spacecraft analyzed the planet using a seismometer to better model the planet's internal composition, and on November 26, 2018, after a journey of 485 million km (301 million mi)  the rover successfully landed on the surface of Mars. In the Elysium Planitia region at 7:53 p.m. GMT, where the seismometer will be deployed and a pit for the temperature probe will be drilled. It will also carry out a series of radio science experiments to complement studies of the internal structure and rotation of Mars.

            <p>
                Mars' terrain , by virtue of it being a terrestrial planet, consists of minerals containing silicon, oxygen, and other elements that typically form rocks. The surface of Mars consists mainly of basalt and tholeii, although the planet is richer in silica than basalt and may be similar to Earth's andesite rocks or silica glass. Parts of the Southern Highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes . High concentrations of the minerals hematite and olivine were found . Much of the surface is covered with iron(III) oxide dust .

                Mars has a gravitational field but no magnetic field  , and parts of the planet's crust appear magnetized, indicating that alternating polarity reversals of a dipole field occurred in the past. This magnetism of magnetically sensitive minerals is similar to the currents found on Earth's ocean floors . One theory, published in 1999 and re-examined in October 2005, suggests plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo stopped working and the planet's magnetism faded.

                After the formation of the planets, everyone was subjected to what is called “ delayed heavy bombardment .” About 60% of the surface of Mars shows a record of impacts resulting from this period,  while much of the remaining surface is probably surrounded by massive impact basins resulting from these events. There is evidence of a massive impact basin in the northern hemisphere of Mars, extending over an area of ​​10,600 by 8,500 km (6,600 by 5,300 mi), or nearly four times the size of the Moon's south pole basin ( Aitken Basin ), and is considered the largest shock basin ever discovered. now.  This theory suggests that Mars was struck by a Pluto -sized planet or asteroid about four billion years ago. It is believed to have caused Mars to split in half, creating the smooth Arctic Basin, also known as the Borealis Basin, which covers 40% of the planet.

                The geological history of Mars can be divided into several periods, but the following are the three primary periods: 
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nocian Period : Formation of the oldest existing surface of Mars 4.5 to 3.5 billion years ago. Nocian-age surfaces are broken by numerous large craters. The Tharsis bulge, a volcanic rise, is thought to have formed during this period, with extensive inundation of liquid water late in the period.</li><br>
                    <li>Hesperian Period (named after Hesperia Planum): 3.5 to between 3.3 and 2.9 billion years ago. The Hesperian period is characterized by the formation of extensive lava plains.</li><br>
                    <li>Amazon Period (named after Amazon Planitia): Between 3.3 and 2.9 billion years ago. The Amazon regions have a few meteorite craters , but they are quite diverse. The Mountains of Olympus formed during this period, along with lava flows elsewhere on Mars.
                        Geological activity is still occurring on Mars. Athabasca Valles is home to volcano-like lava flows about 200 million years ago .  On February 19, 2008, images from Mars showed evidence of an avalanche from a 700 m (2,300 ft) cliff</li>

            <p>
                Data from the Phoenix space probe showed that Martian soil is slightly alkaline and contains substances such as magnesium , sodium, potassium and chlorine. These nutrients are found in gardens on Earth and are essential for plant growth.  Experiments conducted by space probes have shown that Martian soil has a pH of 8.3 and may contain traces of perchloric salt.
                <br>
                <br>
                “ We basically found what appear to be the properties or nutrients that support the possibility of life, whether in the past, present or future,” Sam Kounavis, lead scientist at the Fluid Chemistry Laboratory on Phoenix, told reporters . »
                <br>
                <br>
                Previous experiments have shown that Martian soil has a basic pH of 7.7  , and contains 0.6% salt perchlorate  , a concentration considered very high and making Martian soil toxic. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Canyons abound on Mars, and new areas appear on steep slopes, basins, and valleys. The grooves are dark at first and become lighter with age. Gullies can start in a small area, then spread for hundreds of metres.  Avalanches are now seen as connected to each other. Many other explanations have been put forward, including those involving water or even the growth.

            <summary>Polar Cap</summary>
            <p>
                Mars has two permanently located polar caps . The polar cap causes deposition of 25-30% of the atmosphere.  These seasonal changes transport large amounts of water vapor, resulting in ground-like frost and large cloud clouds. Clouds of ice photographed by the Opportunity spacecraft in 2004. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The polar cap at both poles is mainly 70% water ice. Frozen carbon dioxide accumulates as a relatively thin layer about one meter thick on the northern cap only in boreal winter, while the southern cap has a permanent ice cover about eight meters thick. This permanently dry Antarctic cap is interspersed with flat, shallow, nearly circular craters that expand at a rate of meters per year; This suggests that the permanent carbon dioxide cover over Antarctic water ice is deteriorating over time. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The north polar cap is about 1,000 km (620 mi) in diameter during the northern Martian summer  , and contains about 1.6 million cubic kilometers (380,000 m) of ice, which, if evenly spread over the cap, would be 2 km (1.2 mi) thick. ).  (This compares to the 2.85 million cubic kilometers (680,000 m) volume of the Greenland ice sheet .) The Antarctic ice cap is 350 km (220 mi) in diameter and 3 km (1.9 mi) thick. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The total volume of ice in the Antarctic cap plus adjacent layered sediments is estimated at 1.6 million cubic kilometers.  Both polar caps exhibit a spiral bottom, which recent analysis of ice-penetrating SHARAD radar has shown to be the result of downward spiral winds due to the Coriolis effect . 
                <br>
                <br>
                Seasonal frosts of areas near the southern ice sheet result in the formation of transparent sheets of dry ice 1 m thick above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight heats the subsurface and the pressure from the carbon dioxide sublimates that builds up under the slab and eventually tears it apart. This results in a geyser-like eruption of carbon dioxide gas mixed with dark basalt sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed to occur within a few days, weeks or months, a somewhat unusual rate of change in geology especially for Mars. Gas rushing down the slab to the location of the geyser carves a spider -like pattern of radial channels under the ice  , the process being the inverted equivalent of the corrosion web formed.
