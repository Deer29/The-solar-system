                ( its symbol :) 🜨is the third planet in the solar system in distance from the sun after Mercury and Venus . It is considered one of the largest terrestrial planets and the fifth largest in the solar system , in terms of its diameter, mass, and density. This planet is also called the world.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Earth is home to millions of species  of living organisms, including humans . It is the only place known to have life in the universe . The Earth was formed about 4.54 billion years ago ,  and life appeared on its surface between about 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago.  Since then, the Earth's biosphere has changed the atmosphere and abiotic conditions on the planet, allowing the proliferation of organisms that live only in the presence of oxygen and the formation of the ozone layer , which works with the Earth's magnetic field to block harmful radiation , allowing the existence of Life on Earth's surface. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet rays , and the Earth's magnetic field works to displace and repel charged elementary particles coming from the sun at great speeds and push them away into outer space away from the Earth, so they do not cause harm to living organisms.
                <br>
                <br>
                The physical characteristics of the Earth and the appropriate astronomical orbit in which it revolves around the sun, providing it with warmth, energy, and the presence of water , led to the emergence of life and the continuation of life on it until the present era. It is expected that life on Earth will continue for another 1.2 billion years, after which the increasing sunlight will destroy the Earth’s biosphere. Scientists believe that the sun’s temperature will rise in the future and expand and grow until it becomes a red giant and its diameter reaches the planet Venus or even the Earth’s orbit, as they see of the development of stars similar to the sun in the universe when the star’s life is nearing its end and its hydrogen fuel runs out .  Then the rising heat of the sun ends life on Earth. This is if another cosmic event does not happen to it before that - such as the explosion of a nearby star in the form of a supernova - that ends its life.
                <br>
                <br>
                More than 8 billion people live on Earth,  and the Earth’s various resources work to maintain a huge global population of humans , who divide the world among themselves and are distributed among about 200 independent countries. Humans have developed diverse societies , civilizations, and cultures , and interact with each other in various ways, including Diplomatic communication , tourism, trade , and military combat as well. Various theories and representations of the Earth appeared in human culture. Some ancient civilizations personified it as a goddess, some believed it was flat, and others said it was the center of the universe . The current prevailing belief states that this planet is an integrated environment that requires human supervision to protect it from the dangers that threaten it, which are It will ultimately threaten the person himself.

                Earth is located in the group of planets in the solar system , and the solar system itself is one of the hundreds of billions of stars that make up the Milky Way galaxy . The region that distinguishes the planet Earth around the sun from other planets is an area known as a habitable zone , meaning that the Earth’s distance from the sun, which is about 150 million kilometers, and the Earth’s orbit around the sun in a circular orbit, gives it suitable temperatures that are not too high and not too cold to be suitable for its origin. Life and its continuation. In addition to that, the Earth's appropriate size allows it to retain its atmosphere and the presence of water on it, and the presence of ozone gas in the Earth's atmosphere, which protects living things on it from harmful ultraviolet rays, in addition to its magnetic field , which protects it from fast elementary particles that come with the solar wind , threatening the safety of living things on Earth.

                <br>
                The outer surface of the Earth is divided into several parts:
                <br>
                The solid Earth's crust , which reaches a depth of about fifty kilometers , the geosphere , which reaches a thickness of 4,000 kilometers, and the Earth's solid central core composed of iron and nickel . The Earth's atmosphere exists in a moving, electrically conductive liquid state, such that its movement creates the Earth's magnetic field. The Earth's crust is characterized by floating above the molten Earth's mantle. The Earth's crust is divided into a number of great tectonic plates , which gradually appeared on the Earth's surface due to its gradual cooling over millions of years. This relatively thin crust floats above what is called the geosphere, which is the large part of the Earth's mass and consists of very hot magma located under the crust at a temperature of about 1700 degrees Celsius, and its rate increases as one approaches the Earth's iron center. This magma flows into different parts of the Earth's crust, forming what are known as volcanoes . Water covers about 71% of the Earth's surface in the oceans , which is salty water that supports aquatic life, while the remaining part consists of continents , islands , and rivers , with fresh water necessary for life on land in all its forms of plants and animals .
                <br>
                <br>
                It has not yet been proven that there is life on the surface of any other planet , but the probes that have landed on the surface of Mars may indicate the presence of life in the form of primitive organisms that did not develop much before the alleged life on Mars ended after the weather conditions deteriorated on it. Some scientists explain the probe images by saying that there is a possibility that life existed on Mars in the past, but deciding on this matter requires huge efforts, and sending devices and equipment capable of analyzing the samples or returning them to Earth to study and analyze them. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The Earth's active interior contains a thick middle layer, reaching about 4,000 kilometers in thickness. It constitutes the geosphere , which is a relatively solid liquid, and scientists divide it into a highly viscous liquid outer core, which sometimes comes out in the form of magma to the Earth's surface when volcanoes are active . This outer core is in constant motion that generates the Earth's magnetic field. As for the inner core, it is a very dense solid, and its density increases with increasing proximity to the central core of the Earth, and it reaches about 7 grams/cubic centimeter. The inner core consists mainly of iron and nickel , and the Earth’s core takes a spherical shape with a radius of about 2000 kilometers. . 
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition, the Earth is affected by the planets in outer space , especially the Sun , which revolves in its orbit , and the Moon, which orbits around the Earth. At present, the Earth revolves around the sun once every 365.26 days, in addition to its rotation around its axis. This period of time for its cycle around the sun is called the “sidereal year,” which is equivalent to 365.26 solar days. The Earth's axis of rotation tilts around itself by 23.4 degrees from the perpendicular to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, which results in the diversity of seasons on the planet's surface. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The Earth is characterized by the presence of its only natural satellite, the “ Moon ,” which began revolving around it 4.53 billion years ago. The Moon's rotation around the Earth results in the emergence of the phenomenon of tides , which occur in bodies of water, maintaining the stability of the Earth's axis inclination and the gradual slowing down of its rotation. The Earth's surface was affected by asteroids that fell on it during the period approximately 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago, which led to changes in the surface environment.
                <br>
                <br>
                The mineral resources of the planet and the resources found in the biosphere are considered sources that contribute to the distribution of population on Earth. The Earth's population is concentrated in about 200 countries, each of which enjoys independent sovereignty over its territories, and these countries deal with each other through diplomatic, tourism, trade, and military relations. There are many views adopted by different human cultures about the planet Earth, including a reverence for the Earth to the point of slavery. In the past, it was believed that the Earth was flat , and man did not discover that the Earth was spherical except in the Middle Ages after his scientific methods improved, despite the fact that Muslim scholars as a whole agreed that the Earth was spherical, as Ibn Hazm (d. 456 AH ) says:
                <br>
                <br>
                «وجوابنا وبالله  التوفيق إن أحداً من أئمة المسلمين المستحقين لاسم الإمامة بالعلم لم ينكروا تكوير الأرض ولا يحفظ لأحد منهم في دفعه كلمة بل البراهين من القرآن والسنة قد جاءت بتكويرها» – الفصل في الملل والأهواء والنحل (2/ 78)
                <br>
                <br>
                The environment on Earth allows life because of its appropriate distance from the sun, and the presence of water , oxygen , carbon , and nitrogen , which constitute living matter. It is an integrated environment that needs to be preserved and not harmed, so human life loses its freshness and strength to survive. Some other organisms may also disappear due to human exploitation of the Earth’s wealth. Without an account.

            <summary>Chronology of events that occurred on planet Earth</summary>
            <p>
                Scientists were able to collect detailed information about the past eras of planet Earth. The beginning of the solar system dates back to about 4.5672±0.0006 billion years ago, and 4.54 billion years ago  (this information is not confirmed by 1%), the Earth and other planets in the solar system were formed from a solar nebula - a disc-shaped mass of dust and gas. What remains of the sun's formation? The formation of the Earth through these outer parts was completed within a period ranging between 10 and 20 million years.  At first the Earth was molten , then its outer layer cooled; In order to form a solid crust, this is when water began to accumulate in the Earth's atmosphere. The Moon was formed shortly thereafter, when a Mars-sized celestial body (sometimes called the "giant-body impact hypothesis") with a mass 10% of Earth's mass [  collided with Earth in an accidental impact.  After that, parts of this celestial body merged with planet Earth, and parts of it were scattered in space, but parts of this body settled in orbit and formed the moon. Volcanic activity and the emission of gases from Earth resulted in the formation of the planet's primary atmosphere. The oceans were formed from the condensation of water vapor, which is increased by snow and liquid water carried by asteroids, larger protoplanets, comets, and any planet in the solar system that orbits the sun at a greater distance than Neptune . Two basic possibilities have been proposed for the form of continental evolution:  The first is the steady evolution that continues until the present era,  The second is an initial rapid evolution that occurred in an early period of Earth's history.  Research has shown that the second theory is the closest to the truth, as there was a rapid and initial development of the continental crust,  followed by a steady development over the long term of the continental region.  If this is measured on the scale of time, it has continued over hundreds of millions of years. As the surface of the planet Earth has constantly reshaped itself as the continents formed, and then separated. The continents moved apart and moved on the surface of the Earth, but they sometimes came together again to form a large continent. The continent of Rodinia is considered one of the oldest large continents that appeared approximately 750 million years ago, and then its parts began to separate. Then after that, the continents came together again to form the supercontinent “Panotia”, during the period extending between 600 and 540 million years, and then finally the continent of Pangea was formed , the parts of which separated 180 million years ago.

                environment full of life.  About 4 billion years ago, energy-filled chemical reactions that occurred on Earth produced molecules that had the ability to replicate themselves. Then, approximately half a billion years later, the organism or race from which subsequent species evolved emerged on Earth.  Photosynthesis (the synthesis of chemical compounds in light) allows the energy generated by the sun to be directly exploited for life in all its forms; The oxygen resulting from this process accumulates in the atmosphere, forming the ozone layer (O3) at the top of the atmosphere. This theory explains the origin of mitochondria and plastids (the parts of plant cells that contain chlorophyll), which are the constituent subunits of eukaryotic cells (which lack a nucleus and nuclear membrane). The fusion of small cells within large cells results in the formation of complex cells called eukaryotic cells (i.e., they are characterized by a single nucleus). True multicellular organisms, which form cells within colonies, have more special features.  Thanks to the ozone layer's absorption of harmful ultraviolet rays , life has settled on the surface of planet Earth.

                <br>
                During the 1960s , some scientists hypothesized that a severe snowstorm had struck Earth between 750 and 580 million years ago, during the Pliocene, resulting in most parts of the planet being covered in sheets or sheets of ice. The term “Earth is a snowball” was given to this assumption, and this event receives great attention. Because it precedes the Cambrian explosion, that is, when multicellular organisms began to appear on the surface of planet Earth.  Following the explosion that occurred in the Cambrian period, about 535 million years ago, five major extinctions occurred.  The last extinction event occurred 65 million years ago, when a meteorite hit Earth led to the extinction of dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but small animals such as mammals, which at the time resembled shrews (mouse-like insectivorous animals), remained. The forms of mammals have varied and varied over the course of 65 million years. One of the ape-like human ancestors was able to stand upright on its legs millions of years ago, according to Darwin’s theory .  This led to the development of its ability to use tools and encourage communication between individuals - which It, in turn, contributed to increasing the efficiency of food provision and created appropriate stimulation, which ultimately helped increase brain size and bring humans to where they are today, according to this theory. At the same time, the emergence of agricultural activity and civilizations led to humans having a huge impact on the Earth in a short period, the likes of which had never been seen before - which in turn led to the impact on other forms of life in terms of nature and quantity.  The current pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago, then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3 million years ago. Since then, the polar regions have undergone repeated cycles of precipitation and melting of ice, repeated during a period extending between 40 and 100,000 years, and the last ice age ended 10,000 years ago.

            <p>
                Earth is a terrestrial planet, which means it is a rocky body, not a giant gas body like Jupiter . It is also considered the largest of the four terrestrial planets in the solar system, in terms of size and mass. In addition, among these four planets, Earth also has the highest density, the highest level of gravity on its surface, the strongest magnetic field, and the fastest rotation.  In addition, it is the only planet on which there are active tectonic plates.

            <summary>Shape of planet Earth</summary>
            <p>
                The shape of planet Earth is very close to an oblate spherical shape, as it is a spherical body that is flattened at the poles and indented at the equator .    This distortion results in the rotation of the planet, and it also causes the diameter of the Earth at the equator to be larger than its diameter at the poles by about 43 km.  The average diameter of the reference spheroid is about 12,742 km, which is approximately 40,000 km/ TT ; The meter was originally equal to 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole through the city of Paris in France.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is worth noting that local topography differs from this ideal spherical shape, although these differences are small on a cosmic scale: Earth has an anisotropy of about one part out of 584, or 0.17% of the reference spheroid, which is less than 0.22% of the anisotropy. Allowed to be found between billiard balls.  The largest rates of local variation or deviation in the rocky surface of the planet are represented by Mount Everest (which reaches a height of 8,848 meters above sea level), as well as in the Mariana Depression (which reaches a depth of 10,911 meters below sea level). Because of the indentation of the Earth at the equator, Mount Chimborazo, located in Ecuador , is considered the furthest part from the center of the Earth.
