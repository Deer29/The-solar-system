            <p>
                ( symbol :) ♀is the second planet in the solar system in terms of distance between it and the sun . Venus is about 108 million kilometers away from the sun, and its orbit around the sun is not completely circular. It is an earthy planet like the planets Mercury and Mars , and it is similar to planet Earth in terms of size and composition. Venus was named after the goddess of beauty. As for the reason for calling it Venus, it is according to what was stated in Lisan Al-Arab: Venus means beauty and whiteness, Zahra Zahra and Al-Azhar meaning enlightened white. Venus: radiant whiteness, hence the name Venus. He said in Lisan al-Arab: (And Venus, with the opening of the ha : this white star). That is, its name is due to the brightness of this planet and its visibility from the Earth, due to the reflection of a large amount of sunlight due to the large density of its atmosphere.

            <p>
                Venus is one of the four terrestrial planets , which means that it resembles Earth in its rocky composition, as well as in size and mass. It is often described as Earth's twin.  The diameter of Venus is only six hundred and fifty kilometers less than the diameter of the Earth, and its mass is equal to 81.5% of the Earth’s mass. But conditions on Venus are very different from those on Earth. Due to the dense atmosphere composed mainly of carbon oxides, where 95% of the mass of the atmosphere consists of carbon oxide [ ? ] . While the second element in the composition of the atmosphere is nitrogen , at a rate of only 3.5%.

            <summary>Internal structure</summary>
            <p>
                There is no direct information about the internal structure of Venus or the chemistry of the Earth without data derived from seismology or information about the moment of inertia .  In any case, the similarity in size and density between Earth and Venus imposes the hypothesis of similarity in internal composition: a core , mantle , and crust like the Earth. Venus' core is at least partly liquid because both planets experienced the same cooling rate.  The small size of Venus compared to Earth also means that the internal pressures under the crust are much lower than they are on Earth. The main difference between the two planets is the lack of tectonic plates on Venus, mostly because the crust and mantle have dried out. This reduces heat loss from the planet, prevents it from cooling and explains its lack of internal magnetic field generation.

            <summary>Geographically</summary>
            <p>
                About 80% of the surface of Venus includes soft volcanic plains.  Two high continents make up the rest of its surface area, one in the northern hemisphere of the planet and the other south of the equator . The northern continent is called the Ishtar Highlands (after Ishtar , the Babylonian goddess of love ), and its area is approximately the size of Australia . The highest mountain on Venus is Mount Maxwell , located in the land of Ishtar. Its summit is 11 kilometers above the “average surface elevation of Venus.” Compared to the highest peak on Earth ( Everest ), it rises less than 9 kilometers above sea level. The southern continent is called the Highlands of Aphrodite (after the Greek goddess of love ), and it is the larger of the two regions, as its size is approximately equal to the size of South America . Most of this continent is covered in fractures and craters.

                Mountains , valleys , and impact craters can be commonly found on rocky planets , and Venus has a number of unique surface features. Among these immutable volcanic features is Fara, which is shaped like pancakes and ranges in size from 20 to 50 kilometers, and its height ranges from 100 to 1,000 meters above surface level.

                <br>
                Almost all of the superficial floral features are named after historical or legendary women.  The only exceptions are Mount Maxwell (named after James Maxwell ) and the Alpha and Beta regions.

            <summary>Atmosphere and climate</summary>
            <p>
                Venus has a very dense atmosphere, which consists mainly of carbon dioxide and a small amount of nitrogen . The mass of this atmosphere is 93 times the mass of the Earth's atmosphere , while its pressure on the planet's surface is equivalent to 92 times the pressure of the Earth's atmosphere on its surface. The pressure on the surface of Venus is equivalent to the pressure at a depth of approximately one kilometer under the ocean of [ ? ] the earth. The density of Venus' atmosphere at the surface is 65 kg/m³ (6.5% of the density of water). The carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere combined with thick clouds of sulfur dioxide generate the strongest greenhouse effect ever seen in the solar system, which in turn causes surface temperatures to rise to more than 460°C.  This makes the Venusian surface hotter than the surface of Mercury , which has a minimum temperature of -220 °C and a maximum temperature of 420 °C,  and this despite the fact that Venus is twice as far from the Sun as Mercury is from it and thus receives only 25% of Mercury's solar radiation . It is often said that the surface of Venus resembles hell.

                Studies indicate that Venus' atmosphere a few billion years ago was very similar to what Earth's atmosphere is like today, and there may have been large amounts of liquid water on the surface, but the greenhouse effect - which resulted from the evaporation of the original water - changed this greatly, as It generated a dangerous level of global warming in the atmosphere that led to the planet's current state.
