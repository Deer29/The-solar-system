                ( its symbol :) ♆means in Greek the god of water, and it is called the blue planet . It is one of the planets of the solar system and is the fourth largest of the eight planets. It is the eighth planet of the solar system and the farthest from the sun in the solar system. It is the fourth largest planet relative to its diameter and the third largest planet relative to its mass. . Neptune's mass is 17 times the mass of Earth. It is slightly larger than its close twin, Uranus , which is 15 times the mass of Earth. Neptune completes one revolution around the Sun  every 164.8 years at an average distance of about 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion km). Neptune is named after the god of water and sea in Roman mythology ( Neptune ), where it was discovered on September 23 , 1846.

                Neptune is not visible to the naked eye, and Neptune is the only planet in the solar system that was discovered through mathematical equations and predictions rather than regular observation. The unexpected changes in the orbit of the planet Uranus led astronomers to conclude that the gravitational disturbance was caused by an unknown planet located behind it, and the planet was discovered one degree away from the location expected through mathematical equations. Neptune was discovered by astronomer Johann Gefried Galle on September 23, 1846 , at the degree predicted by astronomers Urban Louverrier and John Couch Adams . Neptune's moon Triton was discovered shortly after the planet's discovery. Scientists did not know about the existence of the planet's 13 moons until they were discovered in the twentieth century. The distance between Neptune and the distant planet Earth makes Neptune appear very small, making it difficult to study with ground-based telescopes. The Voyager 2 spacecraft visited Neptune when it flew by the planet on August 25 , 1989 .  The planet was studied in more detail after the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope and the construction of large ground-based telescopes containing conditioned optics .

                Like Jupiter and Saturn , Neptune's atmosphere consists primarily of hydrogen and helium , as well as hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen . It contains a high percentage of “ ice ” such as water, ammonia and methane . Neptune's interior contains the same components as the planet Uranus: it is composed of rocks and ice.  This is why the planets Uranus and Neptune are considered ice giants .  The reason for Neptune's blue color is that methane molecules occupy the planet's outer regions, giving the planet a blue color.

                Although Uranus' atmosphere is relatively clear, Neptune's atmosphere is characterized by active, visible weather. When the Voyager 2 spacecraft passed by the planet, it observed a storm in the southern half of the planet called the Great Dark Spot , which is similar to the Great Red Spot found on Jupiter . These weather patterns are formed by strong winds, with a speed of about 2,100 kilometers per hour. 2,100 kilometers per hour (580 m/s; 1,300 mph)  Neptune's outer atmosphere is the coldest place in the solar system due to its long distance from the Sun, with temperatures at the top of the clouds reaching 55  K (−218  °C ; −361  °F ). At the center of the planet, it is about 5,400 K (5,100 °C; 9,300 °F).  Neptune has a weak, fragmented ring , which was discovered in 1982 and later confirmed by.

                Shortly after Neptune's discovery, it was called the "Uranian exoplanet" or "Loveriere planet." Or the name proposed for the planet was by the scientist Gal, who suggested the name Janus . In England, Challes called it Oceanus .

                To claim the right to name his discovery, Le Verrier quickly suggested the name Neptune for this new planet. Which was allegedly falsely approved by the French office. In October, Le Verrier sought to name Neptune after him, and was encouraged to do so by the observatory's director, François Arago . This proposal received strong opposition outside France.  Because of this, the French calendars returned the name Herschel to the planet Uranus, after the astronomer William Herschel , who discovered it.

                Struve came up with the name Neptune on December 29, 1846 , for the Russian Academy of Sciences .  After that, the name Neptune became the most internationally agreed upon name. In Roman mythology , Neptune was the god of the sea, a counterpart in Greek mythology to Poseidon . Thus, the mythological names are consistent with all other planets, except for Earth, which was named after the Roman and Greek gods.

                Most languages   today, even in countries without a Greco-Roman culture, use a nomenclature similar to the name "Neptune". In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the planet's name is translated as "King of the Sea." Because Neptune means the god of the sea.  In Mongolian the planet is called "Dalain Van", reflecting the god's role as ruler of the sea. In modern Greek, the planet is called Poseidon .  In the Hebrew language, the name "Rahab" mentioned in the psalm was chosen after it was voted on by the Hebrew Language Council in 2009 as the official name of the planet.  In the Maori language, the name "Tangaroa" was given to the planet, referring to the Maori god of the sea.  In the Nahuatl language the planet is called "Tlāloccītlalli", referring to the rain god tlaloc.

                Neptune has 13 moons, the largest of which is Triton, which orbits at a distance of 354,750 km (220,400 miles) from it, and its radius is about 1,350 km (0.2122 of the Earth's radius). It is the only moon of Neptune that rotates opposite to the direction of Neptune's rotation. Triton has a circular orbit and orbits Neptune once every six days, with a surface temperature of about -235 degrees Celsius (-390 Fahrenheit). There are some geysers on Triton, despite its extreme cold, which the Voyager spacecraft discovered during its famous journey.

                Neptune has four rings, but these rings are much less dense and in size than the rings of Saturn, and they appear to be composed of dust particles, and until now scientists do not know the reason why the spread of dust in them is uneven.
