                ( symbol :) ☿is the smallest planet in the solar system and the closest to the sun . The Arabs called this planet “Mercury.” The origin of the name comes from the source “t-r-d”, meaning “repellent” and “continuous”, meaning one who is continuous in its movement, and also fast in running, hence the name of the planet Mercury, which symbolizes the great speed of the planet’s rotation around the sun .  Languages ​​that do not know the planet by a specific name use the Latin name Mercury , in reference to the Roman god of trade.

            <p>
                The apparent magnitude of Mercury ranges from -2.3 (brighter than Sirius ) to +5.7, and the maximum apparent magnitude is when it is close to the sun in the sky.  Observing Mercury is complicated because of its proximity to the sun, such that it is difficult to observe due to its glare. It can be viewed for a short period at dawn and dusk , and the Hubble Space Observatory has not been able to view it at all until now, due to preventive measures that prevent it from directing it close to the sun .  Mercury can be seen from the southern hemisphere more easily than from the northern hem

            <p>astronomical observations about Mercury. It is believed that these tables were drawn up by Assyrian astronomers , most likely, in the fourteenth century BC,  and the translation of the cuneiform writing of the name of this planet in the tables meant the jumping planet.  The Babylonians’ records of Mercury go back to the first millennium BC, and they called him Nabu , the god of wisdom and writing, according to their mythology .

                In the time of Hesiod , the Greeks knew about the planet Mercury, and they called it “Stilbone” ( Greek : Στίλβων) and “Hermione” ( Greek : Ἑρμάων), thinking that it was two separate celestial bodies. Later they gave him the name Apollo when he is visible at dawn, and Hermes when he is visible at dusk. In the fourth century BC, Greek astronomers realized that the two names belong to the same body.  The Romans later gave the name “Mercury” ( in Latin : Mercurius ) to the planet, which corresponds to the Greek god Hermes, because it moves in the sky faster than any other planet, as does the aforementioned god according to their beliefs.  The Roman-Egyptian scientist Claudius Ptolemy wrote about the transit of Mercury in front of the Sun , and he suggested that the transit is not observed because of the small size of Mercury and that this transit is infrequent.

                Mercury was known to the ancient Chinese as “Xin Xing” ( Chinese : 辰星), and it is linked to the north direction and is in the water phase according to the principle of the five elements ( Chinese : 五行), which the Chinese believed made up the world.

                According to Hindu mythology , the name Buddha was used for him ,  as is the god Odin according to Norse mythology ,  while the Mayans represented Mercury with an owl and sometimes with four owls, two of which were for the morning appearance and two for the night appearance, and all of them served as messengers of the underworld.  In the fifth century, an Indian astronomical text called Suraiya Siddhanta determined the diameter of the planet Mercury to be three thousand and eight miles , that is, with an error less than 1% than the true value of 3,032 miles.

                The Arabs used to call this planet Mercury, in reference to “Tarid” and “Mercury,” meaning the one who continues its journey. This symbolizes the great speed with which the planet revolves around the sun.  As for Muslim astronomers , in the eleventh century AD, the Andalusian astronomer Ibrahim bin Yahya al-Zarqali described the orbit of Mercury as elliptical and resembling an egg.  In the twelfth century, the scientist Ibn Baja observed two dark spots on the surface of the sun, and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi later suggested that these two spots were nothing but the transit of Mercury and Venus . That was in the thirteenth century.

            <summary>Exploring Mercury with ground-based telescopes</summary>
            <p>
                The first observation of the planet Mercury with a telescope was in the seventeenth century by Galileo Galilei . He had noticed the phenomenon of the planetary phase when he observed Venus, but his telescope was not powerful enough to see the phase of Mercury. In 1631 AD , Pierre Gassendi built a telescope that was able to observe the transit of the planet in front of the sun , which was predicted by Johannes Kepler . In 1639 AD , Giovanni Battista Zoppi was able to observe and discover that Mercury has orbital phases similar to Venus and the Moon, and this observation conclusively proved Mercury’s rotation around the sun.

                One of the rare astronomical events is the passage of one planet in front of the other, and it is called the phenomenon of occultation . Mercury and Venus occult once every few centuries. The only astronomical observation of this event occurred on May 28, 1737 AD , and was observed by the scientist John Bevis at the Royal Observatory in Britain .  It is expected that the next occultation will occur on December 3, 2133 AD.

                In 1800 , Johann Hieronymus Schroeter was able to observe some of the topography of Mercury's surface, as he recorded his observation of twenty kilometers of high mountains . Friedrich Bessel then used observations to obtain incorrect estimates of the period of the astronomical orbit, which he estimated at twenty-four hours, and the axial tilt , which he set at seventy degrees.  In 1880 , Giovanni Schiaparli mapped Mercury's surface more accurately and suggested that its rotation period was 88 days, i.e. the same as the astronomical rotation period due to the restriction of tidal forces .  This phenomenon can also be observed with respect to the Moon , and is known as synchronous motion . Efforts to map Mercury were later followed by Ignios Antoniadi, who issued a book in 1934 containing all his maps and observations of Mercury. Many of the characteristics of the planets' surfaces, especially the albedo , were taken from this book.

                In 1962 , a team of Soviet scientists affiliated with the Institute of Radar Engineering and Electronics at the Soviet Academy of Sciences sent and received radar waves and observed the topography of Mercury's surface, making the first discovery of Mercury by radar.  Three years later, an American scientist named Gordon Pettengill used the radio telescope of the Arecibo telescope to monitor the rotation period of the planet, concluding this matter with a period of 58 days.  The theory of Mercury's synchronous motion thus became widely accepted. But the dilemma that scientists faced was that if Mercury was subject to the restriction of tidal forces, then the temperature of the dark surface must be much colder than the values     they obtained from the emission of radio waves. However, scientists refused to drop the theory of the simultaneous movement of the planet and explained this with alternative theories such as the distribution of thermal energy. By wind.

                An Italian scientist named Joseph Colombo noticed that Mercury's period of rotation was two-thirds of its astronomical period, and therefore proposed that the periods of axial rotation and orbit were locked in a resonance equivalent to 3:2 instead of 1:1.  Information later available thanks to the Mariner 10 probe confirmed the validity of this hypothesis,  which means that Eschiaparle and Antonionadi's maps are correct. Ground observation did not reveal much internal information about Mercury, and the correct knowledge about Mercury did not deepen until flying over it.
