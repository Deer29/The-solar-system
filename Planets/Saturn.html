                ( its symbol is:) ♄, and its name is derived from the root “Saturn,” meaning to step aside and distance.  It is said that it was named Saturn because of its distance in the sky . As for the Latin name, it is “ Saturn ,” which is the Roman god of agriculture and harvest .  Its symbol represents the sickle of the aforementioned Roman god.

                Saturn is the sixth planet in terms of its distance from the sun , and it is the second largest planet in the solar system after Jupiter . Saturn is classified among the gaseous planets such as Jupiter , Uranus, and Neptune . Together, these four planets are called “Jovian planets,” meaning “Jupiter-like planets.” The radius of this planet is nine times larger than the radius of the Earth ,  but its density reaches one eighth of the Earth's density, and its mass is ninety-five times greater than the Earth's mass.

                Environmental conditions on Saturn's surface are extreme. Because of its large mass and strong gravity, experts say that its temperatures and extreme pressure exceed the capabilities of scientists and the techniques used, making it difficult to prepare similar conditions and conduct experiments on them in laboratories. Saturn consists of a high percentage of hydrogen gas and a small percentage of helium , while its interior consists of rocks and ice surrounded by a broad layer of metallic hydrogen and a gaseous outer layer.

                It is believed that the electric current in the metallic hydrogen layer contributes to increasing the strength and attractiveness of this planet's magnetic field , which is slightly less intense than that of Earth and its strength reaches one-twentieth of the strength of Jupiter's magnetic field .  The wind speed on its surface is approximately 1800 km/h , which is a very large speed compared to the wind speed on the surface of Jupiter.

                Saturn is characterized by nine rings of ice and dust that revolve around it in one plane, giving it a distinctive shape. Saturn has sixty-one known moons orbiting it, except for small moons,  of which 53 moons have been officially named. Among these moons is Titan , which is the planet's largest moon. It is also the second largest moon in the solar system , after Ganymede , one of Jupiter's moons. It is larger in size than the planet Mercury , and it is the only moon in the solar system that has a significant atmosphere.

                Saturn is the planet farthest from the sun among the five planets that can be seen with the naked eye on Earth . The other four planets are: Mercury , Venus , Mars , and Jupiter . It was the last planet known to early astronomers until the discovery of Uranus in 1781 . Saturn appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright yellowish dot and usually has an apparent magnitude ranging from +1 to 0, and the value of this magnitude in cases of maximum brightness reaches -0.24. It takes Saturn approximately 29 and a half years to complete a complete revolution around the sun. Most people need optical aids ( large binoculars ) magnified by at least 20x to see Saturn's rings clearly.

                The clearest view of Saturn and its rings is when the angle between it and the sun is 180 degrees, so it appears opposite the sun in the sky.

            <p>
                Saturn is perhaps the most famous planet for its ring system, which makes it the most noticeable space object in the solar system.  Saturn's rings make it one of the most familiar and impressive astronomical images, in addition to its frequent appearance in science fiction stories and films. Galileo Galilei was the first to observe it through a telescope when he directed his primitive telescope at the planet for the first time in 1610 ,  but low-resolution viewing led him to mistakenly believe that Saturn is a tripartite planet, consisting of a large central body and two smaller bodies on its sides. The rings may be much younger than the planet itself. Therefore, some senior mathematicians thought that these episodes deserve study. According to Laplace and James Clerk Maxwell 's calculations , Saturn's rings must be composed of many smaller bodies. The rings extend for a distance ranging from 6,630 km to 120,700 km above Saturn's equator, and their average thickness is approximately 20 km. However, the total mass of the rings, which are several hundred meters thick, is only equivalent to the mass of Mimas, and is composed of 93% water ice with a small amount of Impurities, in addition to 7% amorphous carbon .  The particles that form the rings range in size from the size of dust particles to a small car. There are three main theories related to the origin of the rings. The first states that it resulted from material around the protoplanet's disk , which was below the planet's Roche limit , and as a result did not clump together and form moons. According to the second, it resulted from the debris of a moon that disintegrated as a result of a collision, and according to the third, it resulted from the debris of a moon that disintegrated due to changing stresses that resulted in the moon passing within the Roche limit of the planet.  It was believed that the rings of the planets were unstable rings.

                Outside the main rings, at a distance of 12 million kilometers from the planet, there is the Phoebe ring, which is inclined at an angle of 27 degrees from the other rings. Astronomers divided the ring system into seven rings: “A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, “A”, “F”, and “J” (A, B, C, D, E, F, G There is also a Cassini barrier within the rings , which is between rings A and B, and there are also gaps, the most important of which are the Maxwell gap, the Keller gap, and the Encke gap.

                Saturn's rings and moons affect its magnetic field, and this effect is believed to play a role in the formation of the rings. During Titan's rotation within the magnetosphere, quantities of hydrogen and some light elements present in its relatively dense atmosphere escape, and the magnetic field forms them into the form of a small cake of charged particles that were extracted from the icy surfaces of the small inner moons to form another light ring around the Saturnian complex.
