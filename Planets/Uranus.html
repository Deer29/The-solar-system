                ( symbol : ⛢ ) is the seventh planet farthest from the sun , the third largest planet in the solar system , and the fourth in terms of mass . It was named after the god Uranus ( in ancient Greek : Οὐρανός ) in Greek mythology . Although it is visible to the naked eye, it was not recognized by ancient civilizations as a planet, due to its dimness and slow rotation in its orbit.  William Herschel announced his discovery on March 13 , 1781 , expanding the boundaries of known planets for the first time in history. Uranus was also the first planet discovered through a telescope.

                Uranus' composition is similar to that of Neptune , and both have a different composition than the other two gas giants ( Jupiter and Saturn ), so astronomers sometimes classify it as an ice giant. The composition of the atmosphere is similar to that of Jupiter and Saturn, as it is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium , but it contains a higher percentage of ices such as water ice , methane , and ammonia , with some traces of hydrocarbons .  Its atmosphere is considered the coldest in the solar system, with an average temperature of 49 K (-224 °C). It consists of a complex cloud structure, and it is believed that water forms the lower clouds and methane forms the upper cloud layer in the atmosphere.  While Uranus consists of rocks and ice.

                Uranus, like other giant planets, has a ring system , a magnetosphere, and a large number of moons . What distinguishes Uranus most from other planets is that its axis of rotation is greatly tilted to the side, almost with the plane of its rotation around the Sun , so that its north and south poles are positioned where the equator of most planets is. The planet's rings are sometimes seen from Earth as a shooting target, and its moons orbit clockwise around it. Images taken by the Voyager 2 probe in 1986 showed some of the planet's terrain in visible light without any effects of cloud groups or storms like other gas giants. Ground monitoring has shown seasonal climate changes and an increase in weather changes in recent years. Especially when Uranus approaches the equinoxes , wind speeds can reach 250 meters per second.

                The composition of Uranus' atmosphere differs from that of other planets, although it consists of two basic compounds: hydrogen and helium .  Where the mole fraction of helium is the number of helium atoms within each gas molecule and on Uranus it is equal to 0.15 ± 0.03 0.15 ± 0.03  which corresponds to it in the upper layers is a mass fraction of 0.26 ± 0.05 .  This value is close to the mass fraction of the protostar , which is equal to 0.275 ± 0.01 .  This means that the helium did not settle in the center of the planet, as is known in gas giants.  Another anomaly is that it contains methane .  Methane has high absorption fields for visible and near-infrared rays , which makes Uranus's color cyan.  Methane constitutes 2.3% of the atmosphere, with a lower mole fraction below the surface of methane clouds at a pressure of 1.3 bar. This constitutes between 20 and 30% of the carbon available in the sun .  The mixing ratio of hydrogen molecules is lower in the upper layers due to the lower temperature, which reduces the saturation level and causes increased freezing of the exiting methane.  The abundance of some volatiles, including ammonia, water, and hydrogen sulfide , is not known deep in the atmosphere, but their presence is likely to be in higher concentrations than in the rest of the solar system.  Quantities of various types of hydrocarbons have been found in the stratosphere, and are believed to be produced by the photolysis of methane under ultraviolet radiation . The atmosphere also includes ethane, acetylene, propane , and butadiene .  Spectral analysis also revealed the presence of quantities of water vapor , carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide at the top of the atmosphere, and these compounds can arise from external sources such as falling dust and comets.

            <summary>The origin of Uranus</summary>
            <p>
                Many theories point to differences in the origins of gas giants and ice giants.  It is believed that the solar system formed from a giant ball of gas and giants known as the proto-sun nebula . Most of the nebula's gases, mainly helium and hydrogen, formed the Sun, while dust collected to form the protoplanets. As the planet grows, its gravity increases, attracting more gases from the nebula . The more gas is added to it, the larger it becomes, and the larger it becomes, the more gas is included. Until it reaches a critical point, its size increases exponentially. Ice giants do not reach this limit value.  Models of planetary migration have shown that the ice giants formed closer to the Sun than they are now, and later moved to their present position.

            <summary>Moons of Uranus</summary>
            <p>
                Uranus has 27 natural satellites . These moons were given names derived from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope .  The five main moons are Miranda , Ariel, Titania , Oberon , and Umbriel . The masses of the Uranus moon system are the smallest among the gas giants. The mass of the five main moons is only half the mass of Triton, Neptune's moon.  The largest of these moons, Titania, has a radius of 788.9 km, which is less than half the diameter of the Earth’s moon, but it is slightly larger than Rhea , the second largest moon of Saturn, making Titania the eighth largest moon in the solar system. The moons of Uranus have a relatively low albedo of about From 0.20 for Oberon to 0.35 for Ariel).  The moons are composed of ice blocks and rock blocks with approximately 50% icy components and approximately 50% rocky components. The ice may contain ammonia and carbon dioxide.

                Apparently, Ariel has the youngest surface of all the moons, while Oberon appears to be the oldest.  Miranda has deep canyons up to 20 km deep, terraced layers, and a random distribution in surface age and terrain. It is believed that Miranda's ancient geological activity was the result of tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric , perhaps as a result of its orbital resonance ratio with Oberon of 1:3.  Fault processes may be linked to bend fluctuations, which may be the main reason for the formation of the racetrack-like main canyon on Miranda.  It is also believed that there is a 1:4 orbital resonance between Ariel and Titania.
