                the largest planet of the solar system . It is called Jupiter because it spreads throughout its course, that is, it penetrates, goes on, and finds itself in it without lethargy or breakage.  Jupiter was known to ancient astronomers and was linked to the myths and religions of many peoples. The Romans called him Jupiter , the god of the sky and lightning.  Jupiter appears from Earth with great brightness, reaching an apparent magnitude of −2.94, making it the third brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus .

                the fifth planet farthest from the sun and the largest planet in the solar system.  It is a gas giant and its mass is slightly less than 1/1000 of the mass of the Sun , but it is equal to two-thirds of the total mass of the rest of the planets in the group. The classification of gas giants includes Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune, in addition to Jupiter. and these four planets are called Juvenil planets.

            <p>
                Jupiter consists mainly of materials in gaseous and liquid states and is the largest giant planet in the solar system . Its diameter at the equator is 142,984 km and its density is 1.326 g/cm3 , making it the second densest gas planet after Neptune , knowing that its density is less than the density of any of the four rocky planets in the solar system.

            <p>
                Jupiter's upper atmosphere consists of about 88–92% hydrogen and 8–12% helium . This ratio is a volume ratio or a ratio of the number of moles of the molecule . But since the mass of the helium atom is about 3 times the mass of the hydrogen atom, the ratio changes when expressed as a mass percentage, so that the composition of Jupiter becomes about 75% hydrogen and 24% helium, and the rest are different materials. The inner layer of the atmosphere contains materials with a higher density, and the mass percentage of these materials is about 71% hydrogen, 24% helium, and 5% various materials. The atmosphere contains trace amounts of methane , water vapor, ammonia, and silicon compounds . There are also traces of carbon, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, neon , oxygen, sulfur, and phosphine . The furthest layer of the atmosphere contains frozen crystals of ammonia.  Infrared and ultraviolet examination also revealed traces of benzene and other hydrocarbon compounds.

                <br>
                The proportion of hydrogen and helium in the atmosphere closely matches the composition of the primary solar nebula according to the theoretical model. The amount of neon in the upper atmosphere is about 20 parts per million, and this amount is equal to a tenth of what is found in the sun .  Helium is also depleted, even though its percentage is equal to 80% of what the sun contains, and it is believed that the reason for helium depletion is its precipitation into the planet.  The concentration of noble gases in Jupiter is between two and three times what it is in the Sun.

                Based on spectroscopic analysis, it is believed that the composition of Saturn is very similar to that of Jupiter, while the composition of the other two gas planets is different in terms of the hydrogen-helium ratio.  It is worth noting that the abundance of heavier elements in planets farther from Jupiter is not entirely clear due to the lack of probes.

            <p>
                Jupiter has the largest atmosphere among the planets in the solar system, as its atmosphere extends to an altitude of 5,000 km.  Since Jupiter is a gaseous planet, it is customary to consider the base of the atmosphere at the point where the atmospheric pressure is equal to 10 bar , or ten times the Earth's atmospheric pressure.

            <p>
                The figure shows the alternating movement between bundles of cloud layers.
                <br>
                Jupiter is always covered by clouds composed of ammonia crystals , in addition to the possibility of the presence of ammonium sulfide . These clouds are located in the tropopause , and are arranged in different bands according to latitude , and are known as the tropics. These regions are divided into areas with bright colors and dark belts. The overlapping of these conflicting cycles causes storms and disturbances , with wind speeds reaching 100 meters/second.  It was also noted that the regions differed in width, color, and density from year to year, but they remained well noticeable for astronomers to distinguish between them.  Cloud layers are about 50 km deep and contain at least two layers of clouds. The bottom layer is thick and the top layer is thin and more transparent. It is possible that there is a thin layer of water clouds located under the ammonia layer, as evidence resulting from lightning flashes detected in Jupiter's atmosphere. Lightning is usually produced due to the polarity of water, which makes it capable of conducting the electrical discharges necessary to generate lightning.  The value of the electrical discharge reaches more than a thousand times what it is on Earth.  Water clouds form thunderstorms driven by the high temperature from within.

                The brown and orange colors of Jupiter's clouds result from fluctuations in their constituent elements, which change colors when exposed to ultraviolet rays from the Sun. However, the exact composition of the components of these clouds is still uncertain, but it is believed that these compounds are phosphorus , sulfur , or hydrocarbon compounds .  Colored compounds are known as chromophores , which mix with the denser, hotter substrate. These areas occur when the cell load increases , leading to the formation of ammonia crystals, which in turn hide the lower layers from view.

                Jupiter has a small axial shift, which means that the polar region always receives less solar radiation than the equatorial region. The transfer of convection within the interior regions is more effective than in the polar region, and it is believed that this leads to a balance in the temperature of the cloud layers.
